### 💼 Salary Predictive Model: Interpretability and Explainability

### 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on building and explaining a **predictive model for salary estimation** based on demographic and educational features. The goal is not only to predict salaries accurately but also to ensure **model transparency and interpretability** using modern explainable AI (XAI) techniques.

The notebook demonstrates the **full data science workflow** — from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model training, evaluation, and interpretability analysis using **SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)**.

### 🧠 Objectives

* Perform **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.
* Build a **predictive model** to estimate salary levels.
* Evaluate model performance using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R².
* Apply **SHAP** to visualize feature importance and explain individual predictions.
* Communicate results with clear visualizations and insights.

### 🗂️ Data Description

The dataset (from `Book2.xlsx`) includes key features such as:

* **Education Level**
* **Experience**
* **Gender**
* **Job Role**
* **Salary** (target variable)

### ⚙️ Methods & Tools

**Languages & Environment:** Python, Jupyter Notebook
**Key Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, shap

**Workflow:**

1. Data preprocessing and feature encoding.
2. Exploratory visualization to detect trends and correlations.
3. Model training (e.g., Random Forest, Linear Regression).
4. Evaluation of model accuracy and generalization.
5. SHAP explainability for global and local model interpretation.

### 📊 Key Insights

* Educational level and experience significantly influence salary.
* SHAP values reveal that higher education and specific job roles drive positive salary predictions.
* The model achieves high interpretability while maintaining predictive accuracy.
